# PREDACTORS – Predicting Activity in Organic Samples

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and implements a web platform designed for **predicting the biological activity of organic molecules** based on **SMILES notation**, using **machine learning models trained from molecular docking simulations**.

🔬 This platform was developed as part of the research article titled:  
**_“Exploring the molecular potential of natural products against COVID-19 through Molecular Modeling and Machine Learning”_**,  
submitted to the journal **Next Research**.

## 🌐 How the Platform Works

**PREDACTORS** offers an intuitive interface for researchers and chemists to predict whether a molecule is **active** or **inactive** against a selected biological target.

### 🔬 Steps to Use PREDACTORS:

1. **Access the platform**: [https://predactor.vercel.app](https://predactor.vercel.app)
2. **Enter the SMILES code** of the molecule in the input field.
3. **Wait 50 seconds to 1 minute** while the system loads and processes the input through pre-trained machine learning models.
4. **View the prediction**: the molecule will be classified as **`ATIVO`** (active) or **`INATIVO`** (inactive) based on its predicted interaction with the biological target.

> 💡 _No docking software is needed — predictions are made using chemical descriptors and ML algorithms trained from docking data._

## 🚀 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run eject`
⚠️ **Note:** this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!
